*Rules of Transmutation
Activate    Gain access to the wonderful world of Transmutation
Info    Transmutation is easier if you are starting with something that has high elemental purity.
Good examples of common Tranmutation ingredients include:
1. Sand (50% Silicon, required in large amounts, but easily obtainable)
2. Coal (78%) or 92-98% for hard coal (typically mined in Midway)

The density of starting material greatly helps results.

Ritual circles of any size can be created to Transmute things in mass, but the larger the circle the more difficult it is to complete the transmutation process.  10 cubic feet of 50% silicon content sand is collected and put in a Ritual Circle.  (much higher failure if the Sand is not collected and deliberately organized for transmutation) 10 cubic feet of Sand == 1 cubic foot of pure Iron. This pure iron is then easily transmuteable into other shapes and materials. In construction this often results in metal sheets melded into clay bases.
Requires    A succesful INT roll of varying complexity.
