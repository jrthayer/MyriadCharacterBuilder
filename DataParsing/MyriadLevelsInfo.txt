#=======
--DEX--
=======
DEX focuses on accuracy, crit, and acting quickly.  

Your DEX x3 is added as Accuracy Dex x2 is added to Initiative

=======
--INT--
=======
INT focuses on knowledge, varied skills, and wealth.  

Your INT value adds +1 Focus per INT.

=======
--STR--
=======
STR focuses on Health, Armor, and Weapon Damage.  

Your 1dSTR is added to weapon damage rolls.

--------------------------

============
--Accuracy--
============
Accuracy is a stat which determines your chance to hit an enemy.

You also gain Accuracy equal to 3x your DEX.

Accuracy is also required to Critically Hit when attacking.


With 0 Accuracy:

You have a 90% Chance to hit targets with No Cover

You have a 50% Chance to hit targets with Half Cover

You have a 20% Chance to hit targets with Full Cover


With 10 Accuracy:

You have a 100% Chance to hit targets with No Cover.

Any additional increase in Accuracy will offer you a chance to 

Critically Hit targets with No Cover.

========
--Crit--
========
Your crit chance is determined by Accuracy.

When your Accuracy roll exceeds a 100% chance to hit you deal critical damage.

The chance to hit, and therefore critical, is reduced when the target of your attack has Cover.


You need at least +1 Accuracy to crit (101% chance to hit).
1 Accuracy gives +1% crit chance against targets with No Cover.


You need +41 Accuracy to crit Half Cover targets.
You need +71 Accuracy to crit Full Cover targets.

==============
--Adrenaline--
==============
Adrenaline is used during combat on a unique spread of special and basic abilities. 

Each character by default gains 1 Adrenaline at the beggining of a round in Combat. The maximum amount of Adrenaline that can be gained is 8.


Generally, Adrenaline is a useful tool to mitigate damage dealt to you. Chances to be hit when not using a shield is high so forcing Half Cover on attacks is valuable. 

High cost and class specific Adrenaline spenders are like ultimate abilities that reward you for doing well in combat and not needing to spend adrenaline on mitigating damage. 

Stealth and Ranged based characters can more easily access higher Adrenaline due to the nature of where they are positioned.    


When you Critically hit your total damage dealt to the target is multiplied by your Crit Multiplier.

The default Critical Multiplier is 1.5x

==========
--Sanity--
==========
When your Sanity drops to 0 you gain a Madness.  

The MAD stat reduces Sanity loss by an amoutn equal to your MAD stat.  

MAD associated spells will drain Sanity on cast. Various monsters may damage Sanity with attacks. Reading books and many actions can damage your Sanity.


15 Sanity is recovered after a comfortable and safe night's rest. (costs 1 wealth per night's rest outside of a town or safe enviorment)


????If you go down in combat, anything that damages Sanity deals +1 more sanity damage until you rest.)) Maybe not.

============
--Leveling--
============
Everytime you level you will have 1 Skill point to spend in each Stat tree.

If you selected INT and DEX, you would put 1 point in INT and 1 point in DEX.

If you selected DEX and DEX, you would put 2 points in the DEX path.


At level 4 you will select a class.

You select a class in every Stat you have access to and continue leveling them simultaneously.


If you have 2 selections of one stat,
you can choose to put both points into 1 class or select two classes from that same Stat.

@Level 0
#To start the character creation process you select a race and two stat choices. After making your selection select the submit button at the bottom of the Character Tab.

Race each has unique passives and determines what starting stat values the character can have.

The stat selections determine what skill trees the character will unlock skills from. You can select the same stat twice, this results in getting 2 skill points in that tree each level.

For example:

*A STR/DEX character gets 1 STR skill point per level and 1 DEX skill point per level

*A DEX/DEX character gets 2 DEX skill points per level

@Level 1
#This level unlocks Tier 1 Abilities.

These can only be unlocked on level 1 so this decision is important!


=================
Note On Spending Points

When spending points the first point in an ability unlocks the base ability and adds it to the skills tab. 

Each point after the initial point will unlock a modifier to the ability.

If the button says CHOOSE UPGRADE the modifierers currently locked will flash and you will click on the modifier you want to unlock. 

When all available skill points have been spent the LEVEL UP+ button on the character tab is unlocked and can be clicked to level up.
@Level 2
#This level unlocks Tier 2 Abilities and Racial skills.

Tier 2 abilities and Racial skills can be selected at every level except at level 4.
@Level 3
#Same as level 2.

Tier 2 abilities and Racial Skills are available.
@Level 4
#This level unlocks Signature Abilities

These can only be unlocked on level 4 so this decision is important!
@Level 5
#This level unlocks Classes

To select a class click on the class img and click select class.

You select one class in each tree selected at character creation. So if you selected the same stat tree twice you select two classes in that stat tree.

Classes can be selected twice resulting in upgraded passives and the ability to spend 2 points in that class per level rather than 1.
@Level 6
#This level onwards skill points can be put into:
*Tier 2 Skills
*Racial Skills
*Class Skills
